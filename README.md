# x86-manual-mapper
An x86 manual map injector for windows 10, my first real project in c++.
If you have any suggestions on how i could improve it or any questions about it, let me know at https://t.me/ride_thru

Downsides
 - does not run TLS callbacks. the dll i test this with doesn't have them so as of writing this i haven't gotten around to adding support.
 - does not have any x86_64 counterpart, i plan on making this in the future though.
